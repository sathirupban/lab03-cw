			HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
			HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
			HTML consists of a series of elements
			HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
			An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

			<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
			The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
			<h1>My First Heading</h1>
			<p>My first paragraph.</p>
			The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
			A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
