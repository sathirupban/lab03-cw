			HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
			HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
			HTML consists of a series of elements
			HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
			An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

			<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
			The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
			<h1>My First Heading</h1>
			<p>My first paragraph.</p>
			The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
			A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:
			In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.
			Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.
			HTML Documents
			All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
			The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
			The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.
			HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
			html links are defined with <a= href=url></a>
			The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 
			Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
			You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter.
